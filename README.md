I'm civil engineer with a master degree in integrated water resources management. Here I will be exploring and sharing different software tools that help those who manage and monitor flood and drought risks, water resource challenges, and the protection of critical infrastructure. Explore my [GitHub Repositories](https://github.com/aanwarigeo?tab=repositories) for updates to better understanding these vital areas.

 ## Selected Projects & Contributions
 - [Sentinel-1 SAR-based Soil Moisture Estimation](https://github.com/aanwarigeo/sentinel-1-soil-moisture)  
  *Developed a Sentinel-1 SAR-based product to accurately estimate field-scale soil moisture over Morocco's rainfed agricultural regions. This project demonstrated that no-tillage agriculture practices in dryland areas can conserve more soil moisture by 16% compared to conventional tillage agriculture practices.*
