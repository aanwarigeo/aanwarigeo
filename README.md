 ## Selected Projects & Contributions
 - [Sentinel-1 SAR-based Soil Moisture Estimation](https://github.com/aanwarigeo/sentinel-1-soil-moisture)  
  *Developed a Sentinel-1 SAR-based product to accurately estimate field-scale soil moisture over Morocco's rainfed agricultural regions. This project demonstrated that no-tillage agriculture practices in dryland areas can conserve more soil moisture by 16% compared to conventional tillage agriculture practices.*
